# Combine Workshop

Welcome to the SwiftAlps 2019 Combine workshop! The workshop is divided into three parts:

- A short presentation of Combine and reactive programming
- Exploration of a playground to see how the core concepts apply
- An app workshop with four exercises to try your new skills

A fourth part, not part of the workshop itself, is a bonus guide for those interested in writing their own publishers.
